<p>
Sibro’s Animal Shelter was born from love, loss, and a promise.
</p>

<p>
Simba wasn’t just my dog — he was family. He was there during the quiet days,
the difficult moments, and the happiest times of my life. His loyalty,
innocence, and unconditional love showed me what it truly means to care
without expecting anything in return.
</p>

<p>
When I lost Simba, the emptiness was overwhelming. But instead of letting that
loss turn into silence, I chose to turn it into purpose. I realized that the
love Simba gave me could live on through helping other animals who are scared,
abandoned, or waiting for someone to care.
</p>

<p>
Sibro’s Animal Shelter exists to rescue, protect, and give a second chance to
animals who deserve safety and compassion. Every dog we rescue carries a piece
of Simba’s spirit — his kindness, his resilience, and his trust in humans.
</p>

<p>
This shelter is not just a place — it’s Simba’s legacy. A reminder that even
after loss, love can continue to save lives. 💖🐾
